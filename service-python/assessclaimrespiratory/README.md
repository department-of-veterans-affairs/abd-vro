6. Conclude “Yes” to suggest there is sufficient evidence to submit the claim to the rapid ready-for-decision process if Lighthouse returns at least one matched diagnosis code for emphysema, and one or more of the following is true:

6. 
   • Veteran has an additional diagnosis of cor pulmonale, right ventricular hypertrophy, or acute respiratory failure
   • Veteran has an additional diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and a procedure that represents an echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization
   • Veteran has a procedure that represents outpatient oxygen therapy and is active (i.e., “Procedure.performed[dateTime]” is “in-progress” or “Procedure.performed[dateTime]” within one year prior to the date of the claim)
   • Veteran's FEV-1 or DLCO is less than 40 percent of the predicted value and the associated observation date is within one year prior to the date of the claim
   • Veteran's FEV-1 to FVC ratio is less than 40 percent and the associated observation date is within one year prior to the date of the claim
   • Veteran's cardiopulmonary exercise test results are less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption and the associated observation date is within one year prior to the date of the claim
5. Conclude “Partial Evidence” to suggest there is partial evidence to submit the claim to the rapid ready-for-decision process if Lighthouse returns at least one matched diagnosis code for emphysema, and one or more of the following is true:
   • Veteran has an additional diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, however, it is unclear whether an echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization confirmed the diagnosis
   • Veteran has a procedure that represents outpatient oxygen therapy, however, it is unclear whether the procedure is still active (i.e., “Procedure.performed[dateTime]” is not “in-progress” or “Procedure.performed[dateTime]” greater than one year prior to the date of the claim)
   • Veteran's FEV-1 or DLCO is greater than 40 percent of the predicted value or the associated observation date is greater than one year prior to the date of the claim
   • Veteran's FEV-1 to FVC ratio is greater than 40 percent or the associated observation date is greater than one year prior to the date of the claim
   • Veteran's cardiopulmonary exercise test results are greater than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption or the associated observation date is greater than one year prior to the date of the claim
