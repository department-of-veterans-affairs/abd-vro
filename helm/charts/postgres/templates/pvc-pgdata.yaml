    # Due to several issues with EFS (https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03UA9MV1EH/p1677507203922209),
    # we're using EBS, which requires mounting containers to be in the same pod.
    # EBS only supports ReadWriteOnce, which implies:
    # "the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. ReadWriteOnce access mode still can
    # allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node."
    - ReadWriteOnce
  # Until we implement a StatefulSet to retain the associated PV, use the non-retain storage class
  # so that we are not creating a bunch of orphaned PVs when deploy-app.sh calls `helm del`.
