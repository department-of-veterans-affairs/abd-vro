## Authoring Tips

> NOTE: Delete this section, these are just tips for you, the author.

* One sentence per line.
  This makes it much easier to see what changed using source control diffs.
* Don't wrap lines, let the Markdown presentation handle paragraph wrapping.
* Only use one H1 (`#` in Markdown) per file.
