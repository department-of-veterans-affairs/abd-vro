        **When to use this template**
        For existing partner teams, this form is to help the VRO Team understand how their platform can best support your solution. Please answer all questions to the best of your ability before submitting the request. 
        - If your team has not worked with VRO previously, please reach out to **@vro-team** in [#benefits-vro-support](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01Q7979Z7D) to share a bit about your interest in VRO and we'll respond with next steps.

        **What to expect when submitting a request**
        Generally, someone from the VRO Team will respond back within 48 hours acknowledging the receipt of your request. 
        - If the request is small and straightforward they will let you know what Sprint the work can be prioritized in and when you can anticipate the work to be completed.
        - If the request is large they may ask additional questions and/or invite you and your team to a joint feature refinement session. After the feature is refined and split into user stories they can provide a timeline for when the work is anticipated to be completed.
