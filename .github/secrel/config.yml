# Configuration for Snyk
# * This is only required for Maven builds
# Snyk calls it's own internal build from the package manager, similar to a mvn install.
# If your application is built in Java, specify the java-version for Snyk to successfully build the application.
# You will have to change the arguments to match your settings.xml and the Github secret associated with the argument
# snyk:
#   java-version: 16
