# Self-hosted GitHub Action runner
# Once the pod is up and running, it should be visible here in your repo:
# https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/abd-vro-internal/runners
# This is needed to access LHDI's Hashicorp Vault b/c the runner must be in the VA network
# to access LHDI's Vault and have the VA's CA certs installed.
