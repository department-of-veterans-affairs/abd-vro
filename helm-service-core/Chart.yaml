# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# TODO discuss: How can we enforce or automate incrementing this?
version: 0.1.3

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
# TODO decide: For the VRO Core, this appVersion should probably match the version above
# since it's (currently) only making Helm configuration changes.
