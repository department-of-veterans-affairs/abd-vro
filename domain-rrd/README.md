## What/Where/When/Why

Once the primary reason for the abd-vro repository, the Rapid Ready Decision or RRD project was ended in May 2023. Despite the end of RRD, OCTO Benefits decided that the VRO project itself could potentially have an ongoing purpose as an intermediate platform, on which various Benefits-centric APIs and shared services could be hosted.

* What: The domain-rrd directory previously housed the spring boot application that exposed all the core functions of the RRD project.
* Where: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/abd-vro-domain-rrd
* When: March 2024
* Why: As part of [2184 - Move domain-rrd code into separate repo](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vro-team-6557e67173391c000e1409f3/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/abd-vro/2184) the Spring Boot application that was previously hosted in the domain-rrd directory has now been moved to its own repository in efforts to simplify the VRO codebase:
