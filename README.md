# Automated Benefits Delivery - Virtual Regional Office

Guided by the vision to get Veterans benefits *in minutes, not months*, the VA Automated Benefits Delivery team (within the Office of the CTO) seeks to use available data and automated processes to reduce the time that Veterans must wait for a claim decision. The Virtual Regional Office software uses existing health evidence data to help ratings adjudicators make decisions about disability claims.

The overall goal for this project is to build automation to enrich Veteran claims with relevant data and remove unnecessary roadblocks to get Veteran's their benefits faster. Specifically, we aim to:
* Reduce the time a Veteran waits for a decision on an application (aka “claim processing time”)
* Reduce the number of unnecessary medical exams ordered for disability compensation applications (aka “unnecessary exams”)
* Reduce the amount of manual effort required to make a decision on each claim (aka “touch time”)
