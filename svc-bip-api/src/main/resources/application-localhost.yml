# Run `./gradlew :app:dockerComposeUp`, which will expose VRO services on localhost ports,
# which is why localhost is specified below. Now, close only the `vro-app` container, and
# run `./gradlew :app:bootRun` on the commandline or in IntelliJ.
#
# File application-nonprod.yml will also be loaded due to the spring.profiles.group configuration in application.yml
